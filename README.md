## 🚀 How to Run

1. Make sure you have **Python 3** installed.
2. Clone this repository or download the `main.py` file.
3. Run the script:

```bash
python main.py
```
## 🧠 How It Works
The Caesar Cipher shifts each letter in the message by a specified number of positions through the alphabet.

**For example, with a shift of 3:**

A → D

X → A

z → c

It wraps around the alphabet and ignores non-alphabet characters (like numbers, punctuation, and spaces).

## ⚙️ Requirements
- Python 3.x

- No external libraries required

- Uses built-in tkinter, messagebox, and filedialog

## 📌 Notes
Make sure to enter a valid shift value between 0 and 25

You can load text from files and save results as .txt
